# Hangman-Game-using-Python
A **Hangman Game** in Python is a fun and interactive project that introduces core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data handling. In this classic word-guessing game, the player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Each incorrect guess brings them closer to "hanging" as a new part of the hangman is drawn.

**Key Features:**

**Word Selection**: The game selects a random word from a predefined list or a dictionary file.

**Guessing Mechanism**: The player enters a letter guess, and the game checks if it is in the word.

**Tracking Guesses**: The game tracks both correct and incorrect guesses. Incorrect guesses increment the "hangman" drawing.

**Win/Loss Conditions**: The player wins if they guess all letters correctly before reaching a maximum number of wrong guesses; otherwise, they lose.

**Learning Outcomes:**

**String Manipulation** : Check and reveal guessed letters in the word.

**Loops & Conditionals**: Manage repeated guesses and handle game logic.

**Data Structures**: Use lists or sets to store guessed letters and track progress.

This project can be extended with features like difficulty levels, a graphical interface, or a scoring system.
